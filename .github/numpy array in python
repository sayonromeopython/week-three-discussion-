Thanks for post. My main interest was drowed to your explanation of image processing using array.
The NumPy, a library use for numerical computations, can be use to manipulate images,
we can manipulate image using the NumPy array operation by drawing, cropping, filtering, color manioulation, etc. 

Theis is an example of an array to arrange high school students photos
image data are stored in a structured array. 
Structured array is used for gropping different data of different types and sizes. 

a Numpy structured array is created to store high school students information along with the paths to their photos


import numpy as np
num_students = 5
image_size (3, 3)
students_photos = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(num_students, *image_size), dtype=np.uint8)
print(students_photos)
